# Authmenace

Authmenace is a very simple [IndieAuth](https://indieweb.org/indieauth) authorization and token endpoint heavily inspired by [Acquiescence](https://github.com/barryf/acquiescence).

It uses [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io) to grant access and therefore does not need any database.

It is currently used by me on the [wackomenace](https://www.wackomenace.co.uk) website to sign in to other services using GitHub.
